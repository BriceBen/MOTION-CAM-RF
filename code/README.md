This folder contains the source files for the Motion CAM-RF project.
It includes the code for both the ESP32-CAM camera and the M5Stack Tab5 tablet.
The first program (espcam.ino) allows the camera to start an HTTP server that streams an MJPEG video feed over the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network. The second program (esptab5.ino) handles motion detection using the PIR sensor HC-SR501 and automatically displays the camera’s video stream on the Tab5 screen when motion is detected.
Both devices communicate through a local network created by the smartphone hotspot. The entire code was developed in Arduino IDE using C/C++ with the libraries WiFi.h, HTTPClient.h, esp_camera.h, and M5Unified.h.
